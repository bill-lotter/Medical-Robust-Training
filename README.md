**Abstract:**<br>
*Understanding the decision making process of machine learning models is an essential element for deploying computer vision algorithms in clinical practice. We demonstrate that adversarially trained models can significantly enhance usability in clinical practice as compared to standard models. We let six radiologists rate the interpretability of saliency maps in datasets of x-rays, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Significant improvements were found for adversarially trained models and results further improved when employing dual batch normalization. Contrary to previous research on adversarially trained models, we found that accuracy of such models was equal to standard models, when sufficiently large datasets and dual batch norm training were used. To ensure transferability, we additionally validated our results on an external test set of 22,433 x-rays. Our work demonstrates that different paths for adversarial and real images are needed during training in order to achieve state of the art results with superior interpretability.*

## System requirements
